# Exifuscator
Exifuscator is a high-performance utility for the privacy-conscious professional. The mobile app integrates directly into your workflow as a Share Extension, allowing you to audit and obfuscate photo metadata in seconds.

Core Beta Features:
• Share Sheet Integration: Process and mask photos directly from the Photos app or camera roll.
• Ghost Metadata Mode: Inject randomized GPS jitter, shift timestamps, and spoof device signatures to blend into the digital "noise."
• Erase Metadata Mode: Instantly strip all EXIF, XMP, and ICC profiles for a zero-metadata footprint.
• On-Device Processing: Zero-cloud architecture. Your data never leaves your device’s secure enclave.
• Forensic Diagnostics: Click on View Metadata to audit hidden headers, lens specifications, and GPS tags.
